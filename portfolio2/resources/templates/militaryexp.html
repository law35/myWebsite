							<p>I trained to perform all basic fireman apprenticeship functions in engineering areas aboard ship, involving cleanliness, operation, maintenance, and preservation of main propulsion, auxiliary steam or diesel machinery, steam or diesel generators, various pumps, motors, and associated equipment. In addition, I learned to identify basic types and components of naval boilers, steam turbines, reduction gears, propellers and shafting, shipboard electric systems, and internal combustion engines (including gas turbines); which aided me in performing routine maintenance procedures.</p>
